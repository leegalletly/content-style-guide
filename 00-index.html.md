This style guide was created for Mailchimp employees, but has been adapted for Middlebury Libraries.

## If you work at Middlebury Libraries

This is our company style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for the libraries.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.
